#about the data set
The Zoo dataset is a popular dataset frequently used in the fields of machine learning and 	data 	mining for classification tasks.The primary aim of the Zoo dataset is to serve as a benchmark for various classification 	algorithms. It provides a straightforward and well-defined set of features 	that allow practitioners to 	test, compare, and evaluate the performance of different classification methods. This includes 	algorithms such as: Decision Trees,k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN),Naive Bayes,Support Vector 	Machines (SVM),Neural Networks.The Zoo 	dataset comprises 101 animal records, each 	characterized by a set of attributes that describe 	various features of the animals. These attributes are designed to help classify the animals into one of 	seven predefined categories. The dataset is particularly useful for demonstrating classification 	algorithms, feature selection, and data preparation techniques.
